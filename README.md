# 🤖 n8n Agents Collection by Brian Richard

Welcome to my collection of **n8n automation workflows** — a set of smart, efficient, and modular agents designed to simplify repetitive tasks and bring intelligent automation to life.

Each agent (workflow) is built using [n8n](https://n8n.io/), an open-source workflow automation tool, and can be imported directly into any n8n instance — whether self-hosted or cloud-based.
